A mostly unopinionated starter project for using Babel and ES2017+ features in a Node.js server environment as well as providing linting and testing solutions. It provides the setup for compiling, linting and testing your code but doesn't make any further assumptions on how your project should be structured.

It's a small improvement over [Babel's official approach](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server) and [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

Make sure you read the FAQ for more details and info.

### Features:
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the web framework.
- ES2017+ support with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- Automatic polyfill requires based on environment with [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env).
- Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).
- Testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
- [Quick deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and App Engine.
